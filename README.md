# TimestampedValues API

A Django REST Framework application for managing and retrieving timestamped values with efficient caching.

## Features

- CRUD operations for TimestampedValues
- Structured data representation by year and month
- Efficient caching strategy with automatic invalidation
- Pagination, filtering, and ordering
- Bulk creation support

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/candidate_test/fronted/`.

## Usage

Access the API at `/candidate_test/fronted/` to interact with the TimestampedValues data.

## Caching

The application implements a caching strategy to improve performance:
- Cache is automatically warmed on the first request.
- Cached data is used for subsequent requests.
- Cache is automatically updated when new data is added, updated, or deleted.

## Configuration

- Database and cache settings can be configured in `settings.py`.
- Ensure you configure the correct database settings if you are not using the default SQLite setup.
